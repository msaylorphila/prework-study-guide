# <Your-Project-Title>

## Description

My motivation was to learn a new skillset to get myself in a developmer mindset to be ready for bootcamp.
I built this project to test my skills as I learned about HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git.
This project has given me a space to collect notes as I learn more in class.
So far I've learned about the github repository, styling with CSS, building the framework for my website using HTML, and making my website interactive with JavaScript.
